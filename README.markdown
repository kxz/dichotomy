**Dichotomy** is the [Room 208 Blog](http://blog.room208.org/)'s custom Tumblr
theme.  Although generally bare-bones, it does have support for the following 
special features:

* Fully customizable colors
* Narrow-screen presentation using CSS3 media queries (try resizing your
  browser horizontally!)
* Google Analytics -- just enter your account ID and the theme includes the
  required JavaScript for you
* Syntax highlighting provided by
  [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)
* HTML5 sectioning and semantic elements, like `<article>` and `<time>`
* Minimal deviation from a strict, monospaced character grid

You can install the theme by simply copying and pasting the code into the HTML
editor.  Whack "Save", then close and reopen the Customize page in order to
reload the theme's appearance options.

The theme is essentially public domain, but I'd prefer to receive attribution
for any reuse or derivative works; a link to this page is sufficient.  Thanks!
