# Dichotomy

![](screenshots/default.png)

**Dichotomy** is a minimalistic theme built around high-contrast boxes
and the reassuring, regular grid of monospaced fonts.
It comes with built-in mobile styles, support for HTML5 sectioning and
semantic elements like `<article>` and `<time>`, and a whole bunch of
customizable appearance options.


## Installation

Log in to Tumblr, then visit [Dichotomy's Theme Garden
page](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/38335) and click on the *Install*
button.
For information on how to bend the theme options to your will, take a
peek at [the documentation](https://github.com/kxz/dichotomy/wiki).
