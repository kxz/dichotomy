# Dichotomy

![](screenshots/default.png)

**Dichotomy** is a minimalistic theme built around high-contrast boxes
and the reassuring, regular grid of monospaced fonts.
It comes with built-in mobile styles, support for HTML5 sectioning and
semantic elements like `<article>` and `<time>`, and a whole bunch of
customizable appearance options.

This theme was written by [Kevin Xiwei Zheng](https://room208.org/),
and is released into the public domain according to the [Creative
Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
dedication.
I waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work to
the extent possible under law.
Although there is no requirement to do so, I'd appreciate a link back to
this page if you use or create any derivatives of Dichotomy.
Thanks!

## Installation

Log in to Tumblr, then visit [Dichotomy's Theme Garden
page](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/38335) and click on the *Install*
button.


## Appearance options

### Custom colors

The theme's various colors can be changed using the standard selectors.
Use the *Midground Opacity* text field to adjust the background opacity
of block quotes and the like; values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

### Mobile and left-handed layouts

In order to use Dichotomy's mobile styles, you must first disable
Tumblr's default ones by going to *Advanced options* and unchecking *Use
optimized mobile layout*.
If you'd like, you can force all devices to use the mobile styles by
turning on the theme's *Mobile Styles Everywhere* option.

Should you prefer having navigation on the left side and posts on the
right, check the *Left Handed Layout* option, which flips the default
layout horizontally.
Note that Tumblr's teasers for users that are not logged in were not
designed to be displayed on the left, and might look misaligned.
You can always uncheck the *Promote Tumblr* option under *Advanced
options* if this bothers you.

### Subtitle and copyright author

Any text entered in the *Subtitle* field will appear in the title bar on
the index page, and next to your blog's name in the page header.
If you provide a *Copyright Author*, it will also appear in the header
as part of a copyright statement.

### Header backlink

If your blog is part of a larger site, you can include a backlink to
that site in the page header by filling in the *Backlink URL* and
*Backlink Title* fields.
The backlink will appear as the first of your navigation links.

### Google Analytics

If you have a Google Analytics account, just enter your tracking ID into
the provided field.
Dichotomy will include the required JavaScript for you.

### Automatic syntax highlighting

Post a lot of code?
Turn on syntax highlighting, and Dichotomy will use
[highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)
to automatically color code snippets inside
`<pre><code>...</code></pre>` tags.
(This is the default wrapping for Markdown indented code blocks.)
