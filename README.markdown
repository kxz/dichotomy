**Dichotomy** is the [Room 208 Blog](http://blog.room208.org/)'s custom Tumblr
theme.  It's a fairly bare-bones theme, without a lot of special features like
custom colors or infinite scrolling, but it does use HTML5 elements like
`<article>` and `<time>`.  Isn't that cool?

The HTML and CSS make every attempt to be valid, although Tumblr inserts markup
into pages that makes them fail HTML5 validation.

The theme is essentially public domain, but I'd prefer to receive attribution
for any reuse or derivative works, and you should definitely change the CSS
inclusion so that it doesn't pull from my site.  Hotlinking issues aside, I do
tweak my theme fairly regularly, and you probably want to avoid any nasty
surprises.
