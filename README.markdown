**Dichotomy** is [Elaborate Burn](http://blog.room208.org/)'s custom Tumblr theme.
Although minimalistic in appearance, it has support for a wide array of special features:

* HTML5 sectioning and semantic elements, like `<article>` and `<time>`
* Narrow-screen presentation using CSS3 media queries (try resizing your browser horizontally!)
* A whole bunch of customizable appearance options (see below)
* Minimal deviation from a strict, monospaced character grid

This theme is released into the public domain, which means that you are free to modify it as you wish.
However, I'd prefer to receive attribution for any reuse or derivative works; a link to this page is sufficient.
Thanks!


# Installation

Simply copy and paste the code in `dichotomy.html` into the HTML editor.
Whack "Save", then close and reopen the Customize page in order to reload the theme's appearance options.


# Appearance options

## Custom colors

You can change the theme's colors by using Tumblr's color selectors.
The "Midground Opacity" text field can be used to change the background opacity for block quotes and the like.

## Subtitle and copyright author

Any text entered in the *Subtitle* field will appear in the title bar on the index page, and next to your blog's name in the page header.
If you provide a *Copyright Author*, it will also appear in the header as part of a copyright statement using Tumblr's `{CopyrightYears}` template tag.

## Header backlink

If your blog is part of a larger site, you can include a backlink to that site in the page header by filling in the *Backlink URL* and *Backlink Title* fields.
The backlink will appear as the first of your navigation links.

## Google Analytics

If you have a Google Analytics ID, just enter it into the provided field.
Dichotomy will include the required JavaScript for you.

## Automatic syntax highlighting

Dichotomy can use [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) to automatically color code snippets inside `<pre><code>...</code></pre>` tags.
(This is the default wrapping for Markdown indented code blocks.)
